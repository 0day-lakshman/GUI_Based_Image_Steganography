# GUI_Based_Image_Steganography
Image Steganography is a technique used to hide secret messages or files inside images. This GUI-based application allows users to encode and decode messages within images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography. The application provides an intuitive graphical interface for users to easily select images, insert text messages, and extract hidden messages.
